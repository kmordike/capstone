To train the dataset for the initial first run, download the dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species?resource=download
as it is too large to upload to gihub.

The first run of the GUI implementation will take some time, as it must train the classifier and save the results for the next run.
